Release notes
=============

This document describes all the changes made to the *Institutions API*
document, starting from its first beta draft version.


0.2.0
-----

* Moved `<embedded-mobility-factsheet>` out of the `master` branch into a
  separate feature branch, where it will be easier to discuss and
  accept/reject it.

* Moved `<role-id>` and `<iia-id>` relationships out of the `master` branch
  into a separate feature branch, for the same reasons as above.

(We are aiming for the `master` branch to not contain disputable features.)


0.1.0
-----

Initial release.
