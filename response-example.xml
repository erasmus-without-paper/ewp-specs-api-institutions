        Wojtek's comment: I think we should stick with a single "ID element naming
        vocabulary" to avoid confusion. We have already done it this way in the
        Registry API (this also has the benefit of properly distinguishing the
        "primary" primary key):
            <id>uio.no</id>
            <other-id type='erasmus'>N Oslo01</other-id>
            <other-id type='local'>UIO</other-id>
        (Also, probably we should drop one of the IDs, because we have one in the
        attribute, and one in the element. I would drop the attribute.)
        -->
        <id type="erasmus">
            <!-- Mandatory -->
            <institution-id>N Oslo01</institution-id>
        </id>
        <id type="uri">
            <!-- Should probably be mandatory -->

        Wojtek's comments:

        1. Aren't all these addresses "postal"? Perhaps we could find a better
        word than "type" here? Would type be an enumeration? Would this
        enumeration stay the same across different usages of the <address>
        element?

        2. Perhaps we should reuse existing schemas for that. There are many
        results for googling "xml schema for worldwide postal address". Or,
        maybe we should take the easiest way out and make it a string (as
        geocoding has become an easy task nowadays).
        -->
        <address type="postal">
            <box>Boks 1072</box>
            <city>Oslo</city>
            <post-code>0316</post-code>
        </address>
        <country>NO</country>

        Wojtek's comment: What are the possible values of type? Can we have
        a single URL with many types? Is lang required?

        Wojtek's comment: A feature request! Logo URL! Preferably a large JPEG or PNG file
        on a white background with a fixed % of margin (e.g. 15%), but none of these suggestions
        would be required. We could use this for generating thumbnails in our UIs.

        Wojtek's comment: Data on facts sheets is missing. Initially in Oslo we have
        discussed many other elements to be included here, like housing information
        and IRO contacts. I have made some notes back then, they include on all the stuff
        everyone proposed, some of these seemed important:
