                    Attributes:
                    - id

                    Elements:
                    - name (1..*, multilang)
                    - website (0..*)
                      - xml:lang
                      - type (one of them should be IRO)
                      - title
                    - address (0..1)
                    - phone numbers (0..*, generic, non-IRO related)
                    - fax numbers (0..*, generic, non-IRO related)
                    - email(s) (0..*, generic, non-IRO related)
                    - erasmus code (0..1)
                    - erasmus charter, aka EUC number (0..1)
                    - image URLs (0..*)
                      - type: logo (recommended), cover, other
                    - a list of primary department IDs (the ones that can be referenced in an IMA)
                    - a list of academic terms?
                      (BTW: https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/general-issues/issues/7)
                    - IRO section
                      - links to PDF documents (0..*, recommended)
                      - IRO website (0..1),
                      - Lots of various text fields from fact sheets

                        If this is supposed to work out then we'll need 2-5 sentences
                        of description for each of such fields. Who will be able to model
                        this? Also, if the number of fields is more than 5-10 then we might
                        end up with most of them empty. If so, then it might actually be
                        better to use PDF documents instead...

                        Some examples of titles/sections taken from some PDF fact sheet:

                        nominations and applications for incoming erasmus students
                        courses
                        credit system (it's always ECTS?)
                        housing
                        insurance
                        study programme descriptions
                        information about language of instruction
                        language requirement (general)
                        grading
                        exams
                        expected arrival date
                        living expenses, academic expenses, other expenses
                        health insurance

                        - roles, each person can have many

                            Some examples suggested in Oslo:

                            head of international relations
                            contact for students
                            contact other IROs
                            admission coordinator
                            institutional coordinator
                            other types of coordinators
                        - phone numbers (0..*)
                        - fax numbers (0..*)
                        - email (0..1)
