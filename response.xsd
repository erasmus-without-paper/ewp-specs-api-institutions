                    Elements:

                    We have briefly discussed many elements during our meeting in Oslo. I think that
                    it would be desirable to split all the information into two sections, and the
                    IRO-related section would be included only on demand (based on the value of the
                    `include_iro_sections` parameter). This will reduce the size of responses for
                    requests which are only interested in simple properties, such as name and logo
                    image.
